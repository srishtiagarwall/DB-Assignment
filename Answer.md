The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities in the diagram is one-to-many. A product can belong to one category, but a category can have many products. This is indicated by the foreign key  "category_id" in the "Product" table. The "category_id" refers to the primary key "id" in the "Product_Category" table. This creates a link between the two tables, allowing you to associate products with their corresponding categories.

For instance, a product with the ID "1"  might have a "category_id" of "3". This would link it to the product category  that has an ID of "3" ,  which  could be named "Electronics" in the "Product_Category" table.





Solution 2 -
Here are a few ways you can ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned:

1. Foreign Key Constraint: Define a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table, referencing the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table. This constraint will enforce that any value entered in the "category_id" column of a product must exist in the "id" column of the "Product_Category" table, making invalid categories impossible

2. Input Validation:
   i) At the Application Level: When a user creates or edits a product in your application, have the interface display a dropdown list or other selection mechanism populated with valid categories from the "Product_Category" table. This will prevent users from inputting arbitrary category IDs.
   ii) Database Trigger: Create a database trigger that checks the "category_id" of any newly inserted or updated product. If the "category_id" doesn't exist in the "Product_Category" table, reject the change with an informative error message.
   
3. Data Cleanup and Integrity Checks:
   i) Data Cleanup: Perform a one-time cleanup to fix existing products that might have null or invalid values in their "category_id" column. You can either set a default category or delete such products.
   ii) Scheduled Checks: Implement a scheduled job or process to periodically check for products with invalid "category_id" values. These checks can generate reports or alerts to help you maintain data integrity.

Example (SQL - Foreign Key Constraint):

SQL
ALTER TABLE Product
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_Product_Category
FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Product_Category(id);
